    A ``DatasetReader`` knows how to turn a file containing a dataset into a collection
    of ``Instance`` s.  To implement your own, just override the `_read(file_path)` method
    to return an ``Iterable`` of the instances. This could be a list containing the instances
    or a lazy generator that returns them one at a time.

    All parameters necessary to _read the data apart from the filepath should be passed
    to the constructor of the ``DatasetReader``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lazy : ``bool``, optional (default=False)
        If this is true, ``instances()`` will return an object whose ``__iter__`` method
        reloads the dataset each time it's called. Otherwise, ``instances()`` returns a list.

        Returns an ``Iterable`` containing all the instances
        in the specified dataset.

        If ``self.lazy`` is False, this calls ``self._read()``,
        calls ``ensure_list`` on the result (which is a no-op if
        self._read() returns a list, which most of the existing
        dataset readers do), and returns the resulting list.

        If ``self.lazy`` is True, this returns an object whose
        ``__iter__`` method calls ``self._read()`` each iteration.
        Note that if your implementation of ``_read()`` is not lazy
        (i.e. it loads all instances into memory at once), then your
        "lazy" dataset reader is just loading the entire dataset into
        a list each time you iterate over it, which is probably not
        what you want.

        In either case, the returned ``Iterable`` can be iterated
        over multiple times. It's unlikely you want to override this function,
        but if you do your result should likewise be repeatedly iterable.

        Does whatever tokenization or processing is necessary to go from textual input to an

        object and needs to process it to be input to a model.

        The intent here is to share code between :func:`_read` and what happens at
        model serving time, or any other time you want to make a prediction from new data.  We need
        to process the data in the same way it was done at training time.  Allowing the
        ``DatasetReader`` to process new text lets us accomplish this, as we can just call
        ``DatasetReader.text_to_instance`` when serving predictions.

        The input type here is rather vaguely specified, unfortunately.  The ``Predictor`` will
        have to make some assumptions about the kind of ``DatasetReader`` that it's using, in order
